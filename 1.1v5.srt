1
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,960
Hare Krishna

2
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,460
Hare Krishna!

3
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,720
Su Swagatam !

4
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,300
It was a nice and pleasing
experience for me to meet all of you

5
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,860
online, Thank You for registering on this
course on Introduction to Bhagavad Gita

6
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:20,900
We'll be meeting again and again until I
complete this course-plan and hopefully

7
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,880
this interaction, online interaction will
help us one day to meet in person as well

8
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,300
and I look forward to that pleasant
meeting

9
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,160
But what is our objective?

10
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,000
Our objective is to learn Bhagavad Gita,
isn't it?

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,120
Why should you learn Bhagavad Gita?

12
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,940
What is the motivation?

13
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,780
You may say - I am already... You know working as a

14
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,710
teacher, professor, engineer, doctor, nurse

15
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,240
you know, professional,

16
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,360
variegated professionals and you know...
I'm a leader, I'm a housewife,

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,260
I'm working professional. You know, I'm a father, I'm a mother, I'm a student

18
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,850
Everybody has something to do

19
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,840
So while we do
everything that we are doing

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,140
Is there a role of Bhagavat Gita?

21
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,140
So, that is the first and foremost question you would ask me

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,500
and

23
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,720
Let me tell you, Bhagavad Gita
is very important.

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,400
In 1988, when I graduated from
Electrical Engineering,

25
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,200
I felt empty within

26
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,880
and I was feeling within a vacuum
and I didn't know what can fill in that

27
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,840
vacuum

28
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,500
and that is the time, I had in my
hand a Bhagavat-Gita.

29
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,720
Let me tell you - Whether you are a student or a
professional, reverses of life are a must!!

30
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,340
As a student, I may be working very hard,
I may be diligent, I may be attending all

31
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,920
the classes but suddenly, I get a fail
grade

32
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,660
isn't it?

33
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,000
So, how do you handle that
situation. I am doing very well in my

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,180
business and suddenly, I make a huge loss.

35
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,360
How do I handle it?

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,280
or I am a young boy

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
and getting married to young girl. You
know, everything is so nice but within months,

38
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:40,880
our natural match is not there, we
start quarreling and suddenly we go to

39
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,840
the court for divorce.

40
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,040
So, these are the
reverses of life that, you and me all of

41
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:55,860
us, we are going to face. It doesn't
matter, whether I'm in the nascent state of

42
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:03,960
my career or I'm very mature in my
career, doesn't matter, reverses of life

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,140
is the ultimate truth of this world

44
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,560
and Bhagavad Gita teaches us how to deal

45
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:19,120
with these reverses. This is the only
science that is called Life Science.

46
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,530
Anything that happens to me, how do I
deal with that. If you have a disease,

47
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:32,380
you can go to a doctor, isn't it but
when you have a disease

48
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,960
like reverses of life

49
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,640
No doctor can cure it.

50
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,220
Reverses in life

51
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,660
My near and dear ones,

52
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,220
They met an accident and

53
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,280
My whole world collapses, under my feet.

54
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,260
How do I deal with it?

55
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,920
So here no medicine would work

56
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,100
No engineering would work,

57
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,120
None of my wealth can help me.

58
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,780
I need

59
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,200
A Life Science.

60
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,640
Okay

61
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,060
And that is why

62
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,580
We must read Bhagavad Gita.

63
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:19,570
I've given you a little hint, why we must study
Bhagavad Gita. Okay and in particular you

64
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:26,840
must know that, Bhagavad Gita is the
quintessence of all the Vedic knowledge

65
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:37,060
that are there in the form of Vedas, in
the form of Upanishads, Aryankas , Samhitas, Puranas.

66
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:43,180
You name anything. Okay, this is
the quintessence. This is the

67
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,880
gist of everything that is there and

68
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,120
How many verses are there in Bhagavat Gita?

69
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,420
Only 700 verses

70
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:58,870
That means in this world of
busy life, we have an opportunity, just to

71
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:05,520
bath ourselves in 700 verses of
Bhagavad Gita and get

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,180
The lessons of Life

73
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,180
Is that, not very wonderful.

74
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,980
I think
you will appreciate. So, I welcome you

75
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,380
again, to join this course for
registering. After you get benefit , I

76
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:27,080
would request you, please tell your near
and dear ones, your friends, colleagues

77
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:34,560
let everybody come and join us and learn
the science of Bhagavad  Gita.

78
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,940
This Bhagavad Gita that we are
going to discuss, this a timeless science.

79
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:31,620
Every science, every knowledge, a society
possesses, at any point of time, evolves with time

80
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,200
But Bhagavad Gita doesn't
evolve

81
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,900
Why?

82
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,260
Because it's the science of the

83
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,840
Soul.

84
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:45,910
Soul or Atma is eternal and science
of the soul, has to be beyond the

85
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,820
influence of time and this is
Bhagavad Gita

86
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,290
it's the science of life.

87
00:07:52,290 --> 00:08:02,230
In fact, in Bhagavad Gita the entirety of
existence, the way it exists, the complete

88
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,380
science of its existence

89
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,880
is there

90
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,980
That
means,  if I know Bhagavad Gita, I have an

91
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:17,920
opportunity, to know everything in
totality, not in a fragmented way

92
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,140
Okay.

93
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,300
So, let me tell you

94
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,760
everything is existing, before you are
born, (before) I was born.

95
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,800
Before this universe (was) created,

96
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
The Eternal World is existing.

97
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,400
Temporary
world, they manifest

98
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:13,770
they unmanifest but the source of this
temporary world is always existing

99
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,500
and hence

100
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:22,620
Once you know, how to acquire
knowledge from Bhagavad Gita

101
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,940
It's fully satisfying

102
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,060
You don't need any other
literature

103
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,180
Okay.

104
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,140
So, this Bhagavad Gita

105
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,070
has been translated all over the world. In
particularly,

106
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,160
International Society of Krishna consciousness founded by

107
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,360
has taken a lead in translating Bhagavad Gita into all major

108
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,390
languages of this world. So, you can have your copy as well in your own

109
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,510
language. If you have any doubt, please
join us in our Youtube channel as well

110
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,360
as Facebook page

111
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,000
and you will see

112
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,900
that
we will help you to get a copy of Bhagavad Gita

113
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:12,820
The Bhagavad Gita, that we will be
following.

114
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,680
So, this is a eternal science.

115
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
There are two things:

116
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,080
One is Divinity,  the
other is mundane.

117
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,520
In mundane, you see all

118
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:53,570
inabilities, imperfections. In Divinity
there is only perfection.

119
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,420
In mundane, there

120
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,200
is always incompleteness,

121
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,240
In Divinity - there is completeness.

122
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,860
So,

123
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
This is what is Bhagavad Gita.

124
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,020
Bhagavad Gita takes us from the
plane of imperfection to the plane of

125
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,220
perfection.

126
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,700
This is a very nice
analogy. I'm giving you a very nice

127
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,100
analogy.

128
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Suppose, you are residing near
a big reservoir, imagine a huge lake

129
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:59,600
or a ever flowing river then, you will
never look for a pond or a well, anything

130
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,120
because

131
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,870
All that water is necessary for
your cooking, for agriculture

132
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,340
everything you can get from this big

133
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,310
reservoir.
Similarly,  Bhagavad Gita is that book

134
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:24,740
that contains all the knowledge that you
need to live a perfect life. As a human

135
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:31,670
being, we want perfection. We do not want
to lead a life like animal without any

136
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:43,120
purpose. In human life, we need a purpose
and this purpose of life, as it is given

137
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:53,900
to us in Bhagavad Gita. So, the science of
life - as it is, is not there. In

138
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,310
Bhagavad Gita,

139
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,740
when it started 5000 years ago

140
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,500
Krishna spoke to Arjuna

141
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,700
All of you know
this, Right?

142
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Krishna spoke (to) Arjuna - the Bhagavad Gita

143
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,160
What is meaning of the
Bhagavad Gita?

144
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,500
Bhagavan and Bhagavad .

145
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,480
That which comes from Bhagavan, is Bhagavad.

146
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,200
and Gita means song

147
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,000
The song of the Lord.

148
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,900
When God speaks, something amazing

149
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,610
happens.
Imagine, in your locality, if there is an

150
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,150
announcement that a very big man is
coming.

151
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:44,800
Imagine, a Nobel laureate or president of
America, Prime Minister of India, they're

152
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
coming. So, there will be huge gathering

153
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,520
Right?

154
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,960
But instead, if someone says God

155
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,340
has come to speak

156
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,900
What will happen?

157
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,670
Everyone, from every walk of life doesn't

158
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,970
matter, you are in university, you are a
businessman,

159
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,980
you are an administrator, you are in service
provider category,  all walks of life,

160
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,910
irrespective of caste, creed, religion,
everybody will come and hear. And this is

161
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,280
exactly is Bhagavad Gita.

162
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,720
As I told you in the beginning, this is the
motivation!

163
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,820
Why should we study Bhagavad Gita ?,

164
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,280
The reverses of life.

165
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,820
Nobody, in this world is freed from

166
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,660
reverses of life. Just like Arjuna was
confused in the battlefield of

167
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:18,290
Kuruksetra. Similarly, we are all confused
in our own battlefield. As a student in

168
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:24,310
the field of study, we are confused. As
businessman, in the field of business we

169
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,790
are confused. As an administrator, in the field
of administration we are confused.

170
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:37,720
Everyone is confused here or there and
Bhagavad Gita, is there to remove that confusion.

171
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,160
You know sometime
we like to do something, if that

172
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,640
something has been done by some great
personality.

173
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,630
isn't it?

174
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,240
You know when I was

175
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,400
growing up in my childhood days, you know,
I used to read a regular

176
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,740
monthly journal(magazine) and that
magazine, you know every time, there will

177
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,240
be a corner where the favourite food of
great personalities

178
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,220
and when I used to

179
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,640
read that I will go and tell my mom. Mumma,
please make this item.

180
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,740
Right!

181
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,320
So this is what!

182
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,360
we have a tendency to follow, you
know, people who are in higher set up.

183
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,740
In Bhagavad Gita also it is said:

184
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,080
Isn't it?

185
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,200
That whatever, the great people,
they do

186
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,440
the normal ordinary people they follow.

187
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,680
So now, let us hear from some
great people

188
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,400
What they say?

189
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,060
Here is

190
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,620
Mahatma Gandhi

191
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,200
The Father of the Nation

192
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:49,580
And this is happening to me, for last
30-35 years, I'm studying Bhagavad Gita

193
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,740
and every time I read a verse

194
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,960
I have a
new experience

195
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,680
and this will happen to you

196
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,740
Albert Einstein

197
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,540
All of you know, right?

198
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,040
One of the greatest scientists, we

199
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,300
have seen on this earthly planet.

200
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,480
He says

201
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,460
This is Albert Einstein

202
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,320
Aldous Huxley

203
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,780
one of my favorite
philosophers

204
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,660
Before, I took interest in Bhagavad Gita, I was very philosophical

205
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,060
and I have read

206
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,440
not only Aldous Huxley,

207
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,020
Spinoza, Erasmus

208
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,500
Then we have, our Jiddu Krishnamurti

209
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,960
many-many philosophers - I have read the books

210
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,860
and what Aldous Huxley saying

211
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,500
and then

212
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,200
There is another person, you know

213
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,000
you might have

214
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
studied his book

215
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,500
He's a Nobel
laureate, one of his books is "Siddharth".

216
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,480
In fact, to write this book he came to
India, he learned the Indian culture and

217
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,000
then he wrote this book Siddhartha. What
he says?

218
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,960
so Hermann Hesse, the German Nobel laurette, he says

219
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,680
and

220
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:10,040
Before, we enact our journey, journey to be bathing in the message of Bhagavad Gita

221
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,860
It is
important, that we understand the principle

222
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,220
or spirit behind learning
Bhagavad Gita. Any knowledge that you

223
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:29,780
want to have, you must approach
that knowledge with utmost humility.

224
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:36,100
When you go to our school, colleges we
must have respect for our teachers. And

225
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:42,260
Bhagavad Gita is about spiritual
knowledge, knowledge perfect, knowledge

226
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:49,480
eternal and hence our attitude, our
approach to this knowledge has to be

227
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,880
that of utmost humility. In Bhagavad Gita,
Krishna says Himself:

228
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,880
Three points are told here,

229
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,500
Tad viddhi pranipatena

230
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,980
So, we must follow

231
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,920
proper etiquette.

232
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,140
A civilization is known
by the standard of conduct or etiquette

233
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,020
the civilization follows.

234
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,360
So 'Tad viddhi' -

235
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,500
What is that etiquette?

236
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,960
Etiquette is

237
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,680
Pranipatena,

238
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:38,760
With respect and reverence
we should approach - a teacher.

239
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,720
and we should not simply come in front
of the teacher. Suppose, you go to a

240
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,640
teacher and you have no question, you
will not learn anything from him.

241
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,700
So pariprashnena,

242
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,780
that means I must
learn how to ask submissive inquiry

243
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,780
If I do not have questions within my mind.

244
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,240
Like everybody asks questions about

245
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,740
You know

246
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,340
if you are hungry, then you are
asking question -

247
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,180
where can I get food?

248
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,760
If you're thirsty you are asking -

249
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,760
Where can
I get water?

250
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,180
but such questions even

251
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,120
animals ask.

252
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,600
As a human being, we must
learn to ask questions like

253
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,480
what is the purpose of this creation?

254
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,500
Why the solar system is organized the way it is?

255
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,940
Why there are variegated
species of life?

256
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,800
Why I go through suffering?

257
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,780
Although I do not work for it.
So many questions, you can have unlimited

258
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,060
questions.

259
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,460
Unless you have such questions

260
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,520
Unless you have a question like -

261
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,140
Who am I?

262
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,240
I don't want to die but I'm dying, who am I?

263
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,460
When I ask such questions

264
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:05,280
then I must approach a spiritual master.
And there pariprashnena, I must ask

265
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,000
submissive questions and then

266
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,500
Sevaya

267
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,340
I must have the proper etiquette, to render

268
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,980
service to such a wonderful personality.

269
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,000
Why he is a wonderful personality?

270
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,500
Tattva-Darshi

271
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,740
Tattva Darsinah

272
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,520
plural

273
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,220
Tattva Darshi

274
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,460
singular.

275
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,340
So Tattva Darsinah

276
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,880
So, these spiritual masters, they have

277
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:48,660
seen the truth and hence, they can make
me to understand the truth.

278
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:58,500
So this is a very wonderful and
auspicious beginning we are making and

279
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,820
I'm pretty hopeful, that all of us
together will have a very very divine

280
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,040
and pleasurable journey

281
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,800
that will reveal

282
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,980
the Self within.

283
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,200
Hare Krishna!

284
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,160
Thank you very much.
