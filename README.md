# DS3-Project
ML MODEL THAT TELLS THE POSTURE OF THE PERSON

We take 9 different inputs of gyroscope and accelerometer values.

This project uses 4 classification algorithms:
1) KNN to classify 13 different activities into Fall, Active & Ascension Descension.
2) Random Forest Algorithm to further classify each of the 3 types of activities. 

And the final step by connecting the code to flask server in order to give input by using an interface in real time and getting an output which tells about the posture of the person using 2 tier ML model.
